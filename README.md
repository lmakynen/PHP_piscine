# Hive Helsinki project
First project in the web branch. The PHP Piscine lasted for two weeks and everyday we got new assignments.
Rush00 is the only group project. In this project we had to make an online store in pairs.
We had only two days to build a functional and secure webshop so it's a bit rushed as the name suggests.
